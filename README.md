# correlation-with-pyspark
Correlation from CSV data via PySpark

######**Description

I have used ice cream data set. It indicates there is a relationship between ice cream consumption and temperature.

- IC: Ice cream consumption in pints per capita
- Temp: Mean temperature in degrees F.

Same data set with vector assembler to merge two  variables, since Pyspark is calculating correlation for only one vector.
